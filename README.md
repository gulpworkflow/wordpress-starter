# Ripe WordPress Starter
*More Documentation to be added*

## Installing a new project
##### Step 0—Navigate to where you would like your project to be located
Open the terminal (we prefer iTerm) and navigate to your desired location

```
cd you/can/go/anywhere
```

##### Step 1— Run the install script
To install a new static site run the install script command followed by the name of your new project

*Note replace [project-name] with the name of your project*

```
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ripestudios/src--wordpress/master/install.bash) [project name]
```

##### Step 2—Install Node Modules
The install script will prompt if you would like to install the node modules for the new project

*Keep in mind the node modules are close to 200mb*

##### Step 3—Enjoy
Carry forth and make something awesome!
